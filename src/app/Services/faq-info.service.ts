A summarizer tool carries all of the key points in a text over to the condensed version. The content you receive contains a complete overview of the text. For example, pasting 2000 words worth of content into the summarizer can result in a more digestible 200-word version, eliminating nearly Â¾ of the text."

This enables the AI to better understand the meaning behind a text and break it down into a condensed version."
