## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
  - type in youtube urls, copy paste text, upload a .txt or .pdf files
  - The summarized data is sent back to the user once the data has been processed
  - The user can copy paste the output text


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [AngularJS](https://angular.io/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS Preprocessor
- [PrimeNg Components](https://primeng.org/) - For styles


### What I learned

Through this project, i was able to learn how to work with angular's http client to fetch data from backend, how REST convention works and connection of frontend to backend, and a various other things


### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs) - Angular documentation helped me a lot when working with projects, and needed to know how a specific feature was used, and the best way to use it.
- [Flask restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Flask restful helped me create a simple rest framework to send and receive data from the server
